# Database Schema and Operations

## Current Implementation

The database layer provides:
- Prisma ORM integration
- Message persistence
- User management
- Thread organization
- Delivery tracking

### Key Features
1. Message Storage
   - Content storage
   - Thread association
   - User attribution
   - Timestamps
   - Order preservation
   - Parent references

2. Thread Management
   - Participant tracking
   - Thread metadata
   - Message ordering
   - Active status
   - Creation info

3. User Management
   - Profile information
   - Authentication data
   - Role assignments
   - Activity tracking
   - Session management

## PRD Requirements

The database should provide:
1. Data Management
   - Efficient queries
   - Data validation
   - Referential integrity
   - Cascade operations
   - Soft deletes
   - Archival strategy

2. Performance
   - Query optimization
   - Index management
   - Connection pooling
   - Cache integration
   - Batch operations
   - Sharding support

3. Security
   - Data encryption
   - Access control
   - Audit logging
   - Backup strategy
   - Recovery procedures
   - Compliance features

4. Scalability
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Read replicas
   - Write distribution
   - Migration strategy
   - Version control
   - Schema evolution

## Gaps

1. Missing Features
   - Limited indexing
   - Basic validation
   - No soft deletes
   - Limited archival
   - Basic backup
   - No sharding

2. Performance Concerns
   - No query optimization
   - Basic connection handling
   - No caching
   - Limited batch operations
   - No read replicas

3. Technical Debt
   - Basic migrations
   - Limited monitoring
   - No performance testing
   - Basic backup strategy
   - Limited documentation
