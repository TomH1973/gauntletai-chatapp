# Layout and Routing

## Current Implementation

The layout system provides:
- App structure
- Navigation
- Authentication
- Error handling
- Loading states

### Key Features
1. Layout Components
   - Root layout
   - Authentication wrapper
   - Navigation menu
   - Error boundaries
   - Loading indicators

2. Routing System
   - Dynamic routes
   - Protected routes
   - Public routes
   - Error pages
   - Loading pages

3. State Management
   - Auth context
   - User context
   - Theme context
   - Navigation state
   - Error state

## PRD Requirements

The layout should provide:
1. Structure
   - Responsive design
   - Mobile support
   - Theme switching
   - Layout customization
   - Component composition
   - Error handling

2. Navigation
   - Deep linking
   - Route guards
   - Breadcrumbs
   - Navigation history
   - Route transitions
   - Loading states

3. Performance
   - Code splitting
   - Route prefetching
   - Component lazy loading
   - Asset optimization
   - Cache management
   - Error recovery

4. User Experience
   - Accessibility
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen readers
   - Focus management
   - Loading indicators
   - Error messages

## Gaps

1. Missing Features

   - Basic error handling
   - No breadcrumbs

2. Performance Concerns
   - No code splitting
   - Limited prefetching
   - Basic loading
   - No optimization
   - Limited caching

3. Technical Debt
   - Limited testing
   - Basic accessibility
   - No documentation
   - Limited monitoring
   - No analytics
