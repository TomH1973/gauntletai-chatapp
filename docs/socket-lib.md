# Socket Library

## Current Implementation

The socket library provides:
- Socket.IO client setup
- Connection management
- Event handling
- Error recovery

### Key Features
1. Connection Management
   - Auto-reconnection
   - Connection state
   - Error handling
   - Event listeners
   - Timeout handling

2. Event System
   - Message events
   - Presence events
   - Typing events
   - Error events
   - System events

3. State Management
   - Connection state
   - Message queue
   - Delivery tracking
   - User presence
   - Room management

## PRD Requirements

The library should provide:
1. Connection Features
   - Connection pooling
   - Load balancing
   - Failover support
   - Health checks
   - Circuit breaking
   - Retry strategies

2. Performance
   - Message batching
   - Event buffering
   - Memory management
   - Resource cleanup
   - Connection optimization
   - Binary protocols

3. Reliability
   - Message persistence
   - Delivery guarantees
   - Order preservation
   - Error recovery
   - State recovery
   - Conflict resolution

4. Monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Error tracking
   - Usage analytics
   - Health monitoring
   - Debug logging
   - Telemetry

## Gaps

1. Missing Features
   - No connection pooling
   - Basic load handling
   - Limited health checks
   - No circuit breaking
   - Basic retry logic
   - No message batching

2. Performance Concerns
   - Memory leaks possible
   - No resource limits
   - Basic error handling
   - Limited optimization
   - No binary support

3. Technical Debt
   - Limited testing
   - Basic monitoring
   - No documentation
   - Limited error handling
   - No performance metrics
