# Project Context

## Current Status

### Phase 1: Foundation âœ…
We have completed the foundational setup of the chat application:
- All core dependencies are installed and verified
- Infrastructure is set up with Docker Compose
- Security foundation is established with monitoring
- Basic monitoring and logging infrastructure is in place

### Key Components in Place
1. **Infrastructure**
   - Docker containers for all services
   - PostgreSQL 15 for database
   - Redis 7 for caching and pub/sub
   - Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

2. **Security**
   - Clerk authentication integration
   - CORS and CSP headers configuration
   - Rate limiting implementation
   - Comprehensive security monitoring
   - Real-time security metrics and logging

3. **Monitoring**
   - Prometheus metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboards
   - Winston logging
   - Security event tracking
   - Performance monitoring

### Next Steps
1. **Database Setup**
