# System Architecture Overview

## Core Architecture

The chat application is built on a modern web stack with the following key components:

### Frontend Layer
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React for component architecture
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Client-side state management via React hooks and contexts

### Backend Layer
- Next.js API routes for REST endpoints
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Prisma ORM for database operations
- PostgreSQL as primary database

### Authentication Layer
- Clerk for user authentication and session management
- JWT-based API authentication
- Role-based access control

## Key Subsystems

### 1. Message Handling
- Real-time message delivery via WebSocket
- Message persistence in PostgreSQL
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Message status tracking (sent, delivered, read)

### 2. Thread Management
- Support for group and direct messages
- Thread participant management
- Real-time thread updates
- Thread metadata and status

### 3. User Management
- User profiles and presence
- Online status tracking
- User roles and permissions
- Activity status updates

### 4. File Handling
- File upload support
- Image preview and processing
- File storage integration
- Attachment metadata management

## System Interactions

### Client-Server Communication
1. REST API
   - Used for CRUD operations
   - Resource management
   - Authentication
   - File uploads

2. WebSocket
   - Real-time message delivery
   - Presence updates
   - Typing indicators
   - Status changes

### Data Flow
1. Message Sending:
   ```
   Client -> WebSocket -> Server -> Database
                      -> Other Clients (real-time)
   ```

2. Thread Operations:
   ```
   Client -> REST API -> Server -> Database
                     -> WebSocket -> Other Clients
   ```

3. File Uploads:
   ```
   Client -> REST API -> Server -> File Storage
                     -> Database (metadata)
                     -> WebSocket -> Other Clients
   ```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- Connection pooling for database
- WebSocket connection management
- Message pagination
- Caching strategy for static content

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling support
- Database indexing strategy
- Load balancing considerations
- Connection management
