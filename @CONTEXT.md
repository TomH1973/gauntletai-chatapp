# Project Context

## Implementation Status

The chat application implementation has progressed through seven phases and is currently in Phase 8: Testing & Launch.

### Completed Phases (âœ…)

1. **Core Setup & Dependencies**
   - Full stack TypeScript setup with Next.js 14
   - PostgreSQL and Redis databases configured
   - Clerk Authentication integrated
   - Monitoring tools (Prometheus/Grafana) set up

2. **Backend Features**
   - WebSocket implementation with room management
   - Message handling (CRUD, reactions, attachments)
   - Thread management with search capability
   - Real-time features (presence, typing indicators)

3. **Frontend Components**
   - Rich text message composer with file upload
   - Thread and message lists with infinite scroll
   - User presence and typing indicators
   - Real-time updates and optimistic UI

4. **Advanced Features**
   - Message threading with nested replies
   - Rich text support with markdown
   - @mentions with real-time suggestions
   - Comprehensive search functionality

5. **System Polish**
   - Performance optimizations (frontend/backend)
   - Error handling across all layers
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Monitoring and analytics

6. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for core flows
   - E2E tests for critical paths
   - >80% test coverage achieved

7. **Production Infrastructure**
   - Docker/Kubernetes deployment
   - CI/CD with GitHub Actions
   - SSL/TLS and load balancing
   - Multi-region failover
   - Automated backups
   - CDN integration

### Current Phase (ðŸš§)

8. **Testing & Launch**
   - Final testing rounds pending
   - Integration tests in progress
   - Documentation updates ongoing
   - Deployment guide preparation

## Next Steps

1. Complete final testing rounds
2. Finalize integration tests
3. Update deployment documentation
4. Prepare launch checklist

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js 18, Socket.IO
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Cloudflare CDN
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Testing**: Jest, Cypress, Playwright

## Architecture

The application follows a modern microservices architecture with:
- Horizontally scalable application servers
- Stateful database clusters
- Redis for caching and real-time features
- CDN for static assets
- Load balancing and failover support
- Automated backup and recovery

## Security

- Clerk Authentication
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Security headers
- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- Regular security scanning

## Performance

- Optimized bundle sizes
- Code splitting
- Image optimization
- Virtual scrolling
- Database indexing
- Connection pooling
- CDN caching
