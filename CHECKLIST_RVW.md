# üîç Code Review & Quality Assurance Checklist

> **Purpose**: Validate codebase consistency, type safety, and local development reliability

## Core Review Areas

### 1. Type System Integrity üìê
- [x] TypeScript Configuration
  - [x] Strict mode enforcement (enabled in tsconfig.json)
  - [x] Consistent import paths (@/* alias configured)
  - [x] No implicit any usage (strict mode enforces)
  - [x] Proper type exports (types.ts exports shared types)

- [x] Type Definitions
  - [x] Shared types between client/server (comprehensive types.ts)
  - [x] Prisma type integration (schema.prisma matches shared types)
  - [x] Socket.IO event types (well-defined in types.ts)
  - [x] API route types (request/response types defined)
  - [x] Component prop types (properly typed props with interfaces)

### 2. State Management Consistency üîÑ
- [x] Data Flow
  - [x] Client state patterns (React hooks for local state)
  - [x] Server state handling (WebSocket state sync)
  - [x] WebSocket state sync (useSocket hook with reconnection)
  - [x] Error state management (consistent error handling)

- [x] Context Usage
  - [x] Authentication context (AuthContext with proper types)
  - [x] Theme context (next-themes integration)

### 3. Error Handling üö®
- [x] Error Boundaries

### 4. API Consistency üåê
- [x] REST Endpoints
  - [x] Response format standardization (NextResponse with consistent structure)
  - [x] Error response structure (standardized error responses)

  - [x] Route naming conventions (RESTful naming in app/api)

- [x] WebSocket Events
  - [x] Event naming consistency (domain:action pattern)
  - [x] Payload structure (typed payloads with interfaces)

  - [x] Connection handling (reconnection logic)

### 5. Database Operations üíæ
- [x] Prisma Usage
  - [x] Transaction handling (proper transaction usage)
  - [x] Error recovery (error catching and handling)
  - [x] Connection management (connection pooling)

### 6. Authentication Flow üîê
- [x] Clerk Integration
  - [x] Session handling (Clerk middleware)
  - [x] Token management (Clerk auth)
  - [x] User synchronization (webhook handlers)
  - [x] Webhook processing (webhook routes)

- [x] Authorization Logic
  - [x] Role enforcement (role-based checks)
  - [x] Permission checks (resource access)
  - [x] Resource access (middleware)
  - [x] API protection (auth middleware)

### 7. Component Architecture üèóÔ∏è
- [x] React Patterns
  - [x] Hook usage consistency (custom hooks)
  - [x] Component composition (proper props)
  - [x] Prop drilling avoidance (context usage)
  - [x] Performance optimization (memoization)

- [x] UI Consistency
  - [x] Design system usage (shadcn/ui)
  - [x] Responsive design (tailwind classes)
  - [x] Accessibility (ARIA attributes)
  - [x] Theme support (next-themes)

### 8. Documentation Coverage üìö
- [x] Code Documentation
  - [x] JSDoc Comments
    - [x] Utility functions (lib/utils.ts)
    - [x] React components (components/chat/*)
