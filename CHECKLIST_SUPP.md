## Implementation Notes
- Items marked [R][x] are fully implemented and reviewed
- Items marked [ ][x] are fully implemented but not yet reviewed
- Items marked [ ][ ] are planned but not implemented
- Some features may be partially implemented
- Priority should be given to security and core functionality
- Performance optimizations should be validated with metrics

## Validation Requirements
1. Security features must be penetration tested
2. Performance features must be load tested
3. Real-time features must be tested at scale
4. Access control must be comprehensively tested
5. Data integrity must be verified after migrations

## Next Steps
1. Implement remaining RBAC features
2. Add attachment and reaction support
3. Enhance caching strategy
4. Implement advanced security features
5. Add scalability improvements
